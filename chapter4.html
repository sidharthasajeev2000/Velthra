      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 4 – Into the Arena</h2>

      <p>Finally, they entered the arena.</p>
      <p>The crowd buzzed with excitement as the massive steel doors sealed shut behind the trainees. A voice echoed across the coliseum:</p>

      <blockquote>“This test will be conducted as a team match! Each participant will wear combat suits calibrated to measure damage. Once you reach your limit, you're out. Fight fair, fight hard.”</blockquote>

      <p>Uniformed staff handed out sleek, matte-black suits. Each one had glowing lines tracing the vitals—real-time feedback for hits and damage.</p>

      <p>Kael slid into his suit, adjusting the gauntlets. At the weapon rack in the center, his eyes locked onto a hybrid loadout: a plasma rifle with an energy sword slung underneath.</p>

      <p>He grabbed it.</p>

      <blockquote>“You know how to use a sword?” Calvin asked, raising a brow.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“A bit,” Kael replied, tightening the strap. “Gramps lived next to the orphanage. Used to force me to train every single day. Skipped once—had to dodge a broomstick.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“That explains the footwork,” Calvin chuckled, selecting his own gear—dual energy pistols with magnetic holsters.</blockquote>

      <p>Rio and Ron grabbed sniper rifles, nodding to each other. Trollin's team stood across the field, grinning like predators.</p>

      <blockquote>“Let’s break some egos,” Calvin muttered.</blockquote>

      <hr>

      <p>The floor of the arena rumbled.</p>
      <p>Panels beneath them shifted—concrete giving way to foliage. Trees rose, terrain warped. Within seconds, the battlefield had transformed into a dense forest, broken by steep hills and hidden gullies.</p>

      <p>A flare fired into the sky.</p>

      <blockquote>The match had begun.</blockquote>

      <hr>

      <p>Kael moved carefully through the underbrush, every step deliberate. No sign of his teammates.</p>

      <blockquote>"Higher ground," he muttered.</blockquote>

      <p>He sprinted toward a nearby ridge but skidded to a halt—two of Trollin’s teammates exploded from the foliage, one wielding a massive energy axe, the other swinging a heavy plasma hammer.</p>

      <p>Kael's blade ignited with a sharp <em>vrrm</em>. The axe came down hard.</p>

      <p><strong>CLANG!</strong></p>

      <p>The impact jolted through Kael’s arm, nearly knocking the sword from his grip. He sidestepped, narrowly avoiding the hammer that cratered the earth beside him.</p>

      <p>Sparks flew as Kael blocked a follow-up swing, metal screeching against energy. The axe grazed his shoulder pad—warning lights flared red across his HUD.</p>

      <p>He rolled backward, knees hitting dirt. His arms felt numb, like they were filled with lead.</p>

      <p>Then—a sudden <em>crack</em> echoed through the trees.</p>

      <p>A sniper round slammed into one attacker’s chest plate, staggering him. Kael took the opening, slashing upward and catching the edge of the armor—not a kill, but it left a burn.</p>

      <p>Another shot came. The second opponent blocked it with a shimmering shield.</p>

      <p>Kael barely raised his sword in time to parry an overhead blow.</p>

      <p><strong>THOOM!</strong></p>

      <p>The ground shuddered. The hammer carved a hole beside him. One more hit and he was done.</p>

      <p>Then—</p>

      <blockquote>“AAAAAAHHHH!”</blockquote>

      <p>Calvin burst through the nearby bushes, limbs flailing, dual pistols firing wildly behind him.</p>

      <blockquote>“WHY is it always me?!” he yelled.</blockquote>

      <p>Trollin and his enforcer were on his tail.</p>

      <p>Kael didn’t hesitate.</p>

      <p>He surged forward, intercepting the enemy closest to Calvin. His sword arced through the air—a perfect counterstrike.</p>

      <p><strong>CLANG!</strong></p>

      <p>Blocked.</p>

      <p>A shield blast slammed into Kael’s side, knocking him off balance. A fourth enemy—Trollin’s support unit—was perched on a hill, already charging another shot.</p>

      <p>Kael gritted his teeth.</p>

      <blockquote>“We need to break their rhythm…”</blockquote>

      <p>He raised his rifle to fire at the support unit—</p>

      <p><em>CRACK!</em></p>

      <p>Pain exploded through his shoulder. His HUD flashed red.</p>

      <p>Sniper hit.</p>

      <p>But the angle didn’t make sense. It came from above—from the <em>wrong</em> side.</p>

      <p>Kael turned toward the ridge.</p>

      <p><strong>Ron.</strong></p>

      <p>Still holding the smoking sniper rifle. Expression unreadable.</p>

      <blockquote>"Ron..."</blockquote>

      <p>They had barely even met—just exchanged names at the exam center. No reason to trust. No reason to expect betrayal. But still, something about it stung.</p>

      <blockquote>"You betrayed us?"</blockquote>

      <p>Ron didn’t flinch.</p>

      <blockquote>“I survived.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael’s vision blurred, not from pain—but fury.</p>

      <p>Somewhere behind him, Calvin yelled again:</p>

      <blockquote>“WHY is this my life?!”</blockquote>

      <p>And the battle raged on.</p>

      <p>In a twist of absolute chaos, one of Calvin's wildly misfired shots ricocheted off a fallen armor plate—luck and dumb trajectory turning into precision. The beam struck the previously staggered enemy squarely in the helmet, disabling his suit and knocking him out of the match.</p>

      <blockquote>"Wait—did I just... actually hit something?"</blockquote>

      <p>Before anyone could react, another sharp <em>crack</em> echoed through the trees.</p>

      <p>Ron dropped.</p>

      <p>A red flash pulsed across his suit as he slumped down. Eliminated.</p>

      <blockquote>"Shot confirmed," came a voice over comms.</blockquote>

      <p><strong>Rio.</strong></p>

      <p>Nowhere in sight, but watching. Waiting. Firing from cover like a ghost.</p>

      <p>The enemy formation cracked.</p>

      <p>Calvin took the opportunity to drag Kael—half-conscious and bleeding virtual damage—into the underbrush.</p>

      <p>He may have been chaotic in combat, but Calvin had <strong>platinum-tier skills</strong> in hiding and running. By the time Trollin regrouped, the two were gone.</p>

      <p>Behind a collapsed tree root, Calvin patched up Kael with the auto-medkit.</p>

      <blockquote>"Still breathing?"</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"Barely," Kael grunted. "Where's Rio?"</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"Still ghosting. He'll find us."</blockquote>

      <p>Minutes later, Rio appeared from the mist, calm and unreadable.</p>

      <blockquote>"You two look like a charity case."</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"He got shot! I ran logistics!" Calvin defended.</blockquote>

      <p>They huddled in the brush, catching breath, hearts pounding.</p>

      <blockquote>"We need a plan," Kael said, gripping his half-fused sword.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"Agreed," Rio replied. "They have numbers. We have surprise. Let’s use it."</blockquote>

      <p>And just like that, the second stage of the fight was about to begin.</p>
