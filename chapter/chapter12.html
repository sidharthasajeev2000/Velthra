      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 12 – Blood and Sweat</h2>

      <p>The bell rang sharp and cold across the academy.</p>
      <p>The students were led to the training grounds — a massive open field surrounded by concrete walls and a looming observation tower. The sun beat down mercilessly, and even the birds had the sense to stay quiet.</p>
      <p>Their instructor stood waiting. A broad-chested, scar-faced man with a presence that could shake mountains. His sheer energy level seemed capable of out-Calvin-ing Calvin — and that was saying something.</p>
      <blockquote>“Alright, listen up, shrimps!”</blockquote>
      <p>he barked, voice like a military airhorn.</p>
      <blockquote>“Out here, we train your bodies, sharpen your minds, and grind you into something that might resemble a soldier. So let’s get started.”</blockquote>
      <p>He cracked his neck like it was a threat.</p>
      <blockquote>“Start running. I don’t want to see anyone slacking.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Uh… how many laps, sir?”</blockquote>
      <p>someone from the crowd asked, timid.</p>
      <p>The instructor’s glare could’ve melted steel.</p>
      <blockquote>“IF I WANTED YOU TO KNOW HOW MANY ROUNDS, I’D HAVE SAID! NOW SHUT UP AND START RUNNING!”</blockquote>
      <p>The group scattered into motion like frightened deer.</p>
      <p>A few laps in, two boys peeled off from the running group and stumbled to the sidelines.</p>
      <blockquote>“Ugh… I’m done,”</blockquote>
      <p>one groaned, hands on knees.</p>
      <blockquote>“That’s it. I’m finished.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Yeah,”</blockquote>
      <p>the other chimed in.</p>
      <blockquote>“We, need… conserving energy. For, like… bird watching.”</blockquote>
      <p>Their voices were faint, too far off to recognize.</p>
      <p>The rest of the class kept running.</p>
      <p>After a minute, Velmira frowned.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hey… is it just me, or is it suddenly really quiet?”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael glanced around.</p>
      <blockquote>“You're right. I don’t hear any wheezing. Or complaining. Or—”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Dumb flirting attempts?”</blockquote>
      <p>Trollin added.</p>
      <p>They all exchanged confused glances mid-run.</p>
      <blockquote>“…Something’s wrong,”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael muttered.</p>
      <p>A few more strides later, the group rounded a bend—</p>
      <p>And came to a jarring stop.</p>
      <p>There, lying flat on their backs like peaceful casualties of war, were two very familiar idiots.</p>
      <p>Calvin and Rio. Half-buried in dust. Completely motionless.</p>
      <blockquote>“Wait… is that—?”</blockquote>
      <p>Velmira squinted.</p>
      <blockquote>“…Our idiots?”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael finished.</p>
      <p>Trollin knelt briefly, poking Calvin’s forehead.</p>
      <blockquote>“Yep. They’re alive. Just… rebooting.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“They really did go down,”</blockquote>
      <p>Velmira whispered in awe.</p>
      <blockquote>“That explains the silence.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“They took the chaos with them,”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael muttered, looking genuinely disturbed.</p>
      <p>The instructor stomped over like thunder on legs.</p>
      <blockquote>“Something funny over there?”</blockquote>
      <p>Everyone immediately stood straight.</p>
      <blockquote>“No, sir!”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“You wanna join them? I can make that happen real fast.”</blockquote>
      <p>Everyone shook their heads faster than their legs were moving.</p>
      <blockquote>“Then what are you WAITING FOR? MOVE!”</blockquote>
      <p>And with that, the squad bolted forward — away from the cratered corpses of their friends and the wrath of a coach who wasn’t even winded.</p>
      <p>By the end of the session, students were dropping like flies.</p>
      <p>One by one, the coach began pulling them off the field, near collapse.</p>
      <p>Only three figures remained, still running.</p>
      <p>Trollin. Kael. Selene.</p>
      <p>No banter. No whining. Just relentless rhythm, dust rising around their feet, their bodies moving on sheer willpower alone.</p>
      <p>The rest of the class sat off to the side, nursing bruises and egos, watching silently.</p>
      <p>Whatever was pushing those three forward — pride, rage, or stubborn spite — it was clear:</p>
      <p>This wasn’t just training anymore.</p>
      <p>It was something else.</p>
      <p>The sun hung low now, casting long shadows across the worn-out field.</p>
      <p>The instructor checked his watch.</p>
      <blockquote>“Halt. At ease.”</blockquote>
      <p>The three still running — Kael, Selene, and Trollin — finally dropped.</p>
      <p>They didn’t sit. They didn’t stagger. They collapsed, hitting the ground like marionettes whose strings had been cut.</p>
      <p>The coach walked past them without slowing.</p>
      <blockquote>“Good.”</blockquote>
      <p>That was all he said. But for a second, the entire field went still. No groaning. No joking. Just silence.</p>
      <p>And somehow, that one word felt louder than a speech. Kael couldn’t help the faint, exhausted smile tugging at his face.</p>
      <blockquote>“Based on today’s performance,”</blockquote>
      <p>the instructor called out, turning to the rest of the gasping, crumpled students,</p>
      <blockquote>“you’ll be split into new groups. Assignments will be posted tomorrow on the notice board.”</blockquote>
      <p>He jerked his thumb toward the two dirt-covered bodies still lying peacefully in their shallow trenches.</p>
      <blockquote>“Someone collect these two pieces of trash and drag them back to the dorms.”</blockquote>
      <p>A few students groaned. Trollin, already sitting upright, shook his head.</p>
      <blockquote>“Should’ve left them as fertilizer.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“We are fertilizer,”</blockquote>
      <p>Calvin mumbled, face down in the dirt. “Emotionally.”</p>
      <p>The coach gave them all one final glance.</p>
      <blockquote>“Dismissed.”</blockquote>
      <p>And with that, the field emptied — boots dragging, legs trembling — but hearts pounding a little stronger.</p>
      <p>Because somehow, even through the dirt and the madness… it still felt like victory.</p>
