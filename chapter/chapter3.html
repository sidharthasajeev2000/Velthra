      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 3 – Noble Problems</h2>

      <p>The testing center was a madhouse. Students pushed and shoved, eager to get registered, some yelling over each other, others already forming squads.</p>

      <p>Calvin didn’t care. He was trying to bulldoze his way through the crowd, dragging Kael behind him like a ragdoll.</p>

      <p>That’s when it happened—he accidentally bumped into someone.</p>

      <p>A tall, broad-shouldered cadet spun around, eyes narrowing with disgust. His voice was sharp, entitled, and loud enough to make people around them go quiet.</p>

      <p><em>"You? Here? This isn’t a kennel for strays."</em></p>

      <p>He shifted his gaze to Kael and sneered.</p>

      <p><em>"And you. Pathetic. You think you belong here? Touching what’s meant for <strong>pure bloodlines</strong> like us? I should have you both scrubbing walls."</em></p>

      <p>Kael felt his stomach twist, but before he could say anything, Calvin stepped forward.</p>

      <p><em>"Look, whatever’s between you and me—fine. But leave him out of it. Who I make friends with is none of your business."</em></p>

      <p>The noble’s face twisted in rage.</p>

      <p><em>"I should kill you for what you did. I’m Trollin Drake, son of Rank-3 Officer Favius Drake. I could—"</em></p>

      <p><em>"Do nothing,"</em> Calvin interrupted flatly. <em>"You and I both know you can’t touch us within Academy grounds."</em></p>

      <p>Trollin clenched his fists. His voice cracked with fury.</p>

      <p><em>"You little—after what you did to me—!"</em></p>

      <p>He raised his hand and swung.</p>

      <p>Calvin flinched, bracing for impact. But nothing came.</p>

      <p>He opened his eyes—and froze.</p>

      <p>Kael was standing in front of him, holding Trollin’s arm with one hand, unmoving. Trollin let out a squeal of pain, trying to yank away, but Kael’s grip was iron.</p>

      <p>Calvin stared.</p>

      <p>Kael’s eyes were calm. Dead serious.</p>

      <p><em>"I have no clue how this <strong>idiot</strong> wormed his way in… but I’m not letting anyone hurt him."</em></p>

      <p>Then he shoved Trollin back.</p>

      <p>Trollin stumbled, caught by his lackeys. His face flushed red with rage.</p>

      <p><em>"You… <strong>you dared touch me?!</strong> You lowlifes should bow to me! I’ll kill both of you in the team match. Count your last breaths."</em></p>

      <p>And with that, he stormed off into the crowd.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Kael exhaled slowly. Calvin, still a little stunned, gave him a crooked smile.</p>

      <p><em>"Well... that escalated."</em></p>

      <p>They reached the registration booth together. Kael sighed.</p>

      <p><em>"Great. Now no one’s going to want to team with us."</em></p>

      <p>Calvin grinned.</p>

      <p><em>"Think again."</em></p>

      <p>He pointed to a group of cadets nearby—mostly commoners, people from the lower districts. They were smiling, impressed.</p>

      <p>Soon, their squad was registered: four members, all outcasts in one way or another.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>As they walked toward the training arena, Kael couldn’t help but ask:</p>

      <p><em>"Okay… but why does Trollin hate <strong>you</strong> more than me?"</em></p>

      <p>Calvin scratched his head.</p>

      <p><em>"Huh? Nah, he’s just... angry in general."</em></p>

      <p>Rio, one of their new teammates, chimed in.</p>

      <p><em>"No offense, I just joined... but it really seemed like he wanted to murder <strong>you</strong> more than any of us."</em></p>

      <p>Calvin winced.</p>

      <p><em>"Okay, okay. Fine. I <strong>might</strong> have done something bad."</em></p>

      <p>Kael raised an eyebrow.</p>

      <p><em>"I’m going to regret asking this, but... what did you do?"</em></p>

      <p>Calvin coughed.</p>

      <p><em>"So... back at the institute, before we came here—we were in the same class. I had a crush on his sister."</em></p>

      <p>Kael blinked. Rio leaned forward.</p>

      <p><em>"...And?"</em></p>

      <p><em>"Well, he found out. Beat me black and blue with his friends. Her dad pulled her out of school."</em></p>

      <p>Kael nodded slowly.</p>

      <p><em>"Okay, that’s... harsh. But that can’t be all."</em></p>

      <p>Calvin hesitated.</p>

      <p><em>"Right. Well. As revenge, I... may have flirted with his girlfriend."</em></p>

      <p>Kael stared. Rio gasped.</p>

      <p><em>"You did <strong>what</strong>?!"</em></p>

      <p><em>"Stole her from him, technically. She dumped him. For me."</em></p>

      <p>Kael buried his face in his hands.</p>

      <p><em>"You flirted with his <strong>sister</strong>, then stole his <strong>girlfriend</strong>?! WHY?!"</em></p>

      <p><em>"Oh, and his sister still likes me,"</em> Calvin added casually. <em>"Even more now that I dumped the girlfriend."</em></p>

      <p>Kael looked at Rio. Then at their other teammate.</p>

      <p><em>"Is it too late to change teams?"</em> he asked, half-smiling, half-crying.</p>

      <p>Calvin wrapped an arm around him, grinning ear to ear.</p>

      <p><em>"Yup. Too late. You’re mine now, buddy."</em></p>

      <p><em>"NOOOOOOO…"</em> Kael groaned. <em>"My peaceful life…"</em></p>
