      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 6 – The Repercussions</h2>

      <p><blockquote>“My Lady Velmira, why are you backing them?”</blockquote>
      Professor Halvors whined from the side of the arena, his voice grating.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“I support whoever I want,”</blockquote> Velmira snapped, stepping past Squad C-7 without even glancing at them.
      <blockquote>“What is the basis of their disqualification? I want to hear it.”</blockquote></p>

      <p><blockquote>“They cheated, My Lady,”</blockquote> the professor said, swallowing.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“How did you reach that conclusion, you idiot?”</blockquote>
      Her words hit like thunder, eyes blazing as she squared up to him.</p>

      <p>The crowd stirred again, murmurs growing louder—some doubting, some supporting. The air was electric with tension.</p>

      <p>Trollin stepped in, desperate to regain control.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“You don’t have to interfere. It’s my problem!”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Velmira turned, calm but lethal.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Say one more word and I’m calling Dad.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Trollin froze like a glitching training sim.</p>

      <p>That’s when the Dean arrived, his long coat trailing like storm clouds, voice calm but heavy with authority.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“What’s going on here?”</blockquote> he asked.</p>

      <p>Velmira pointed directly at Trollin.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“He’s sabotaging the results. Accusing Squad C-7 of cheating with no proof.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The Dean’s eyes shifted to Kael, Calvin, and Rio—standing there like they’d just wandered into someone else’s family drama.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“You three,”</blockquote> the Dean said, <blockquote>“Why are you accused of cheating?”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Trollin cut in, waving his arms.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“They had extra tools! No way Kael had camouflage. And Calvin? Sniping? They must’ve rigged it!”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The Dean turned to the professors.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Were their weapons scanned pre-match?”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The professors went pale. One coughed nervously.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Well… we didn’t expect them to…”</blockquote></p>

      <p><blockquote>“Run the scans,”</blockquote> the Dean said coldly.</p>

      <p>Minutes passed. A tech officer returned.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Everything checks out, sir. No foreign equipment. Just legal gear.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The Dean raised a brow.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Trollin, it seems you were right. They shouldn’t have won. Kael—come forward. Explain how you did it.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Velmira moved to protest, but the Dean lifted a hand.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Let him speak.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Kael stepped forward and took a breath.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“The night before the fight,”</blockquote> he said, <blockquote>“we were hurt. Our formation was broken. We couldn’t fight like ourselves. So we swapped roles.”</blockquote></p>

      <p><blockquote>“Swapped?”</blockquote> the professor blinked.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“I borrowed Rio’s camo unit. He gave up stealth to maintain distance with a sniper rig. Calvin…”</blockquote> he glanced back at his friend, <blockquote>“…was the distraction.”</blockquote></p>

      <p><blockquote>“He ran through the forest drawing fire,”</blockquote> Kael continued. <blockquote>“Rio provided cover. That’s how we took them down.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Trollin snarled.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“That still doesn’t explain how you shot from the trees! You’d need sniper power!”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Rio smiled and stepped forward. He pulled out Calvin’s dual pistols.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Let me show you something cool.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>He aimed both guns—one forward, one backward—and fired. The front blast propelled the second like a railshot, hitting the dummy target with sniper-level force.</p>

      <p>Rio holstered smoothly.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“It’s easy to align when you control both guns. Physics just needs a little help.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The professor blinked, stunned.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“But you said they were about to lose…”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The Dean’s face darkened.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Professor, you tell me—why didn’t you notice their equipment had been tampered with before the test?”</blockquote></p>

      <p>Gasps again.</p>

      <p>The pressure in the arena dropped like a hammer. One professor tried to speak but the words died in his throat.</p>

      <p>Another professor stepped quietly beside the Dean, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Sir,”</blockquote> he said softly.</p>

      <p>The Dean nodded, composed again.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Since the truth has come to light,”</blockquote> the Dean declared, <blockquote>“I hereby certify Squad C-7 as passing—with full score.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>He glanced at Kael and winked.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Nice work.”</blockquote></p>

      <p>The arena exploded in cheers. Even those who had doubted before now screamed C-7’s name.</p>

      <p>Kael turned to Rio and Calvin.</p>

      <p>Calvin leaned in, grinning wide.</p>

      <p><blockquote>“Told you I was good at running.”</blockquote></p>
