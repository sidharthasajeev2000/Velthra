      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 7 – The Storm</h2>
      <p>“Yes... someone is very good at running.”</p>
      <p>The voice boomed from behind Calvin.</p>
      <p>He froze.</p>
      <p>Kael and Rio peeked over his shoulder—only to find Velmira, arms crossed, eyebrow arched.</p>
      <p>A bonk landed squarely on Calvin’s head.</p>
      <p>He did a flawless sideways tumble, popped up, and said smoothly:</p>
      <p>“Hey, beautiful.”</p>
      <p>As if the hit—and gravity—had never happened.</p>
      <p>Kael and Rio slowly turned to Velmira, expecting fury.</p>
      <p>Instead, they were met with a warm, polite smile.</p>
      <p>“You must be Calvin’s friends?” she said.</p>
      <p>“Yup,” Kael replied, deadpan. “Sadly, that happened.”</p>
      <p>She giggled softly.</p>
      <p>“So you all met here at the academy?”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” Kael nodded. “And thank you—for standing up for us.”</p>
      <p>“It’s no big deal,” Velmira said, waving it off. “You were wrongly blamed. Any friend of Calvin is a friend of mine.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Calvin mentioned you briefly,” Rio chimed in. “Pleasure to meet you.”</p>
      <p>Velmira’s cheeks tinted pink. She glanced affectionately at Calvin.</p>
      <p>“Is that so…”</p>
      <p>Calvin grinned smugly, arms crossed like a conquering hero.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I was honestly surprised he landed someone like you,” Rio continued casually. “Considering he flirts with every gir—”</p>
      <p>Kael lunged forward and slapped a hand over Rio’s mouth.</p>
      <p>Too late.</p>
      <p>Velmira’s gentle smile turned to demonic rage.</p>
      <p>Calvin was already cowering in a corner.</p>
      <p>“So,” Velmira said, her tone now icy, “you met recently, right?”</p>
      <p>“Y-Yes,” Kael replied, eyes wide.</p>
      <p>“And in that short time… he still found time to flirt with other girls?”</p>
      <p>She cracked her knuckles and began marching toward Calvin.</p>
      <p>“I said something I shouldn’t have,” Rio muttered, stepping back.</p>
      <p>“Yup,” Kael nodded solemnly. “Now we just need a coffin for our new friend.”</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a voice crackled over the academy intercom.</p>
      <blockquote>“All first-year squads, report to the canteen for post-evaluation briefing.”</blockquote>
      <p>With newfound camaraderie and bruised pride, the trio headed off. Calvin tried his best to please Velmira, who walked beside him with an unreadable expression.</p>
      <p>But trouble came early.</p>
      <p>They turned the corner—and ran into Ron.</p>
      <p>Without a second thought, Rio grabbed him by the collar, fury bursting through.</p>
      <blockquote>“Traitor!” he barked.</blockquote>
      <p>Ron didn’t fight back.</p>
      <blockquote>“Do what you want. I had to survive,” he said, eyes low. “You’ll leave this place eventually. I don’t have that luxury. My family lives in his territory.”</blockquote>
      <p>For once, Calvin's usually goofy face turned serious. He gently placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p>
      <blockquote>“Sometimes, we get a choice,” he said quietly. “Sometimes, we don’t. Even if it’s staring right at us.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rio backed down. Velmira offered Calvin a look—half impressed, half concerned—and they moved on in silence with her on Calvin's arm, consoling him.</p>
      <p>But silence doesn’t last long when Trollin is nearby.</p>
      <p>As they neared the canteen, his voice boomed through the corridor.</p>
      <blockquote>“Why are you still clinging to his hand?” he growled, glaring at Velmira and Calvin.</blockquote>
      <p>Calvin instantly bounced back to his usual energy.</p>
      <blockquote>“Jealous? Still no one wants to hold yours?”</blockquote>
      <p>“You think this is funny?” Trollin seethed. “You know what you did?!”</p>
      <p>His voice cracked, not with anger—but something closer to wounded pride.</p>
      <blockquote>“What did I do?” Calvin asked with wide, fake innocence.</blockquote>
      <p>Then, from behind them came a sultry voice.</p>
      <blockquote>“You made me fall for you.”</blockquote>
      <p>A tall, beautiful girl with dazzling eyes strolled past them, flipping her hair.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hey boys, miss me?” she winked.</blockquote>
      <p>Calvin flinched. Velmira’s gentle aura evaporated.</p>
      <blockquote>“What are you doing here, Layla?” she hissed.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“My business is wherever you all are,” Layla replied playfully, brushing past Calvin.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There’s no need for you here,” Velmira snapped. Her tone resembled Trollin's for a moment—and somehow, that made it scarier.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Still playing noble princess, Velmira?” Layla said with a smirk. “Thought you'd outgrow the need to control everything.”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael pulled Calvin aside, whispering.</p>
      <blockquote>“What is going on?”</blockquote>
      <p>Calvin scratched his head sheepishly.</p>
      <blockquote>“Well… remember Trollin’s girlfriend?”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“That’s her?!” Rio and Kael said in unison.</blockquote>
      <p>Calvin nodded with the grin of a man who knows he’s not making it to old age.</p>
      <p>Rio nearly cried.</p>
      <blockquote>“How, bro? HOW?!”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael sighed, watching the growing storm.</p>
      <blockquote>“This academy has more drama than my entire orphanage put together.”</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Calvin got dragged back into the eye of the storm—Velmira and Layla were toe-to-toe, sparks flying, crowd gathering.</p>
      <p>Rio activated his camouflage and turned away, whispering:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m out. I didn’t sign up for this.”</blockquote>
      <p>But a hand gripped his collar from behind.</p>
      <blockquote>“If I’m screwed, you’re in it with me, no escapeing” Kael muttered, dragging him back.</blockquote>
      <p>Layla finally spun on her heel.</p>
      <blockquote>“See you around, handsome,” she said to Calvin, blowing a kiss.</blockquote>
      <p>Trollin stormed after her, muttering something about dignity.</p>
      <p>Kael and Rio stared at the giant canteen doors ahead.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re screwed,” they said together.</blockquote>
      <p>And with that, they walked into the lion’s den—new friends, tangled history, and chaos waiting to be served hot.</p>
