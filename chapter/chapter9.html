      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 9 – New Rooms, Old Troubles</h2>

      <p>The courtyard buzzed with first-years crowding around the massive digital noticeboard. Names, dorm numbers, and class assignments flickered across the screen.</p>

      <p>Kael barely got a look before a cheerful volunteer stepped in front of him.</p>

      <blockquote>“Kael, right? Come with me. You’re being escorted to your dorm.”</blockquote>

      <p>He followed, weaving past excited students and confused parents until they stopped before a grand door etched with his name. The metal shimmered with some kind of nano-light.</p>

      <blockquote>“Wait, this is mine?” Kael blinked.</blockquote>

      <p>Inside, the room looked like a mini-suite—sunlight through tall windows, a desk loaded with orientation material, and a neatly folded uniform resting on his bed.</p>

      <blockquote>“These aren’t mine… is this my roommate’s?” he asked, scratching his head.</blockquote>

      <p>The volunteer chuckled.</p>

      <blockquote>“Nope. All yours. You don’t have roommates.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael turned to her, still stunned. She grinned and stuck out a hand.</p>

      <blockquote>“Name’s Fia. And here, we don’t use family names. Academy rule to promote equality.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Ah,” Kael nodded. “Well… thanks, Fia.”</blockquote>

      <p>She tilted her head, smiling gently.</p>

      <blockquote>“You know, with your combat rank, I expected someone fierce. But you’re kind of a sweetcake.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael’s ears turned pink.</p>

      <blockquote>“This room’s bigger than my whole dorm back at the orphanage…”</blockquote>

      <p>That stopped Fia in her tracks for a moment. Then she ruffled his hair.</p>

      <blockquote>“You earned it. Be proud of yourself.”</blockquote>

      <p>She ran him through the dorm rules, then added with a playful wink:</p>

      <blockquote>“And if you ever need help, feel free to call me. Being asked for help by a cute junior isn’t the worst thing in the world.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael mumbled something awkward, still stunned by the sheer luxury around him.</p>

      <blockquote>“Freshen up and head to the mess. Dinner’s hot and the gossip’s hotter,” she said before disappearing down the hall.</blockquote>

      <p>Kael sat on his bed, still unsure if he belonged here.</p>

      <blockquote>“Man… I feel so out of place. Would’ve been nice if I could’ve shared this with the others.”</blockquote>

      <p>Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the dormitory…</p>

      <blockquote>“Oh YEAH, baby! We’re in the same dorm!” Calvin fist-pumped, tossing his bag onto a bunk.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Later,” Rio muttered, scanning his dorm number. “Let’s check Kael’s room later. I heard it’s like a suite.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Wait…” Calvin squinted at the dorm listings.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Oh no.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“What?” Rio asked.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“We’re doomed,” Calvin said flatly, pointing.</blockquote>

      <p>Next to their names was a third: Trollin.</p>

      <blockquote>“No. No no no,” Rio muttered. “We are so screwed.”</blockquote>

      <p>The mood on the walk to their room was... grim.</p>

      <blockquote>Rio: “Trollin’s our roommate? Fantastic. Hope he doesn’t cheat his way into my locker too.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Calvin (pulling out a squashed snack bar): “Yeah… no. He won’t.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Rio (frowning): “You were arguing with him five hours ago.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Calvin (shrugging): “Yeah, I argue with the mirror every morning too. Doesn’t mean I don’t respect it.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Rio (blinking): “You’re saying you respect Trollin?”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Calvin (serious now): “He’s a pain. Arrogant. Anger issues deluxe. But he never cheats. Ever.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Rio (quiet): “You sure?”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Calvin (nodding, tossing him a snack bar): “Watched him in training. Broke his collarbone once rather than break a rule. He’d rather lose clean.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Rio (softening): “Still the biggest pain on campus.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Calvin (grinning): “Second biggest. I still hold that crown.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Rio (grinning): “So you know that you are a little jerk.”</blockquote>

      <p>When they reached the room, the door was ajar.</p>

      <p>Trollin stood inside, arms crossed, glaring at the two like they’d tracked mud across his soul.</p>

      <blockquote>“Oh great,” he muttered. “Why are the gods testing me like this?”</blockquote>

      <p>Calvin pushed the door open with a smile. “Because they love me.”</p>

      <p>Rio slunk in behind him, deadpan as ever.</p>

      <p>Trollin looked at the dorm sheet, then at them.</p>

      <blockquote>“You’re kidding.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Nope,” Calvin said, tossing his bag onto the bed. “Roomies.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I’m cursed.”</blockquote>

      <p>Rio slid into his bunk and whispered to Calvin, “You sure he won’t murder us in our sleep?”</p>

      <p>“Pretty sure,” Calvin replied. “Ninety percent.”</p>

      <p>Trollin shot them both a look. “Just stay out of my way.”</p>

      <p>“Wouldn’t dream of it, now sixty percent.” Calvin said, already putting up a dartboard on the closet door.</p>

      <p>The silence that followed was loud and awkward—but not hostile. Somehow, between shared chaos and bruised egos, a strange balance had settled.</p>

      <p>Back in Kael’s room, the lights dimmed to a warm glow. Outside, the academy bell chimed softly in the wind. He leaned back on the bed, letting the day finally settle in his bones.</p>

      <p>For the first time in a long time, he felt something close to peace.</p>

      <p>Even if tomorrow promised nothing but trouble.</p>
