  <h2>Chapter 8 ‚Äì The Queen and the Chaos</h2>

  <p class="narration">The canteen buzzed like a beehive, students crowding around tables and food counters, chatting, laughing, and basking in post-exam relief. Plates clattered, trays shuffled, and the warm smell of fried bread and spices hung thick in the air.</p>

  <p class="narration">Velmira sat with Squad C-7‚ÄîKael, Calvin, and Rio‚Äîengaged in light conversation as if she weren‚Äôt the daughter of one of the most powerful noble houses. She was all warmth now, a sharp contrast to her earlier fury.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "You alive there, man?"</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Yup. Definitely alive. I almost saw my grandparents, though. Pretty sure they waved."</p>
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "Dude, how did you get punched so fast? We were with you five minutes ago."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs my fault, really. You see, I thought Kael had similar taste as me. Saw him surrounded by girls, figured he was a flirting pro. Turns out, my guy was talking about swords. And recoil stability. And‚Ä¶ metallurgy."</p>
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> (choking on drink)</p>
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "But why get punched for that? Also, really? Kael? Interested in girls? I pegged him as a 'rank-grind-til-I-die' kind of guy."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Exactly! That‚Äôs where I messed up... I thought he was peeking under skirts. Turned out, he was inspecting the bronze layering technique."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "So I pulled him aside and tried to give him the Art of Calvin‚Äôs Flirting 101. Dude stared at me like I handed him a bomb."</p>
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "That‚Äôs it? You got decked for <em>that</em>?"</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "No. I got decked because I said‚Äîand I quote‚Äî‚ÄòLet me teach you how to pull girls, my child.‚Äô"</p>
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "And then?"</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> (pointing to Velmira) "Then <em>she</em> said‚Äîand I quote‚Äî‚ÄòYou‚Äôll make him gutter-brained too‚Äô and <em>bam</em>‚ÄîI woke up at this table."</p>
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "She gave you good advice."</p>
  </div>

  <p class="narration">Rio finally burst out laughing, almost falling from his seat. Calvin gave him a wounded glare.</p>

  <blockquote>"All first-year squads, please remain seated. Before room allocations, we‚Äôll be awarding students who demonstrated exceptional performance."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">There was a wave of murmurs, chairs squeaking as everyone straightened up.</p>

  <blockquote>"We begin with the student who achieved <em>Rank 1</em> in the written and interview rounds. Please welcome to the stage‚ÄîMiss Selene."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">Spotlight. The crowd stilled as a girl walked to the center stage. Selene. She was calm, composed, with platinum hair tied in a loose braid and eyes like frozen silver. Everything about her radiated elegance and precision.</p>

  <blockquote>"Thank you. First, I‚Äôm honored to be part of this institution. I ranked first in strategy, first in written, and highest in the interview. But..."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Let‚Äôs be honest. Some of you are walking disasters."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">There was a ripple of laughter. A few boos. A few cheers.</p>

  <blockquote>"I just hope my future dorm isn‚Äôt next to one of <em>them</em>."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">She ended with a polite bow, stepping back to thunderous applause from some and nervous chuckles from others.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Rio:</strong> "She scares me."</p>
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "She <em>is</em> scary."</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote>"Now, there is one more special award. This student shocked his examiner with unconventional tactics, earned a perfect combat score, and took out the top-ranked team using pure strategy and grit."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">Kael froze. Rio and Calvin flanked him like prison guards, grabbing his arms.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "Nope."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Oh yes."</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote>"This student is‚Ä¶ Kael of Squad C-7!"</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">The crowd burst into confused whispers and gasps.</p>

  <blockquote>"No way." <br> "Who even is that guy?"</blockquote>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "GO GO GO!"</p>
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "Don‚Äôt do this‚Äî"</p>
  </div>

  <p class="narration">Rio and Calvin hoisted him onto their shoulders like a conquering hero. The crowd roared. Boys from other squads joined in the cheer.</p>

  <blockquote>"See? Even a disaster can beat the queen!"</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">That one stung. Selene‚Äôs proud smile cracked for a fraction of a second, her eyes turning icy again as they locked onto Kael.</p>

  <p class="narration">Kael, panicking, was tossed onto stage with zero grace. He stumbled to the mic.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "Uh‚Ä¶ sorry‚Ä¶ Dean."</p>
  </div>

  <p class="narration">The Dean chuckled.</p>

  <blockquote>"Relax, son. It‚Äôs good to surprise us now and then."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">Kael turned, catching Selene‚Äôs death glare. He gulped.</p>

  <blockquote><em>*I'm gonna die.*</em></blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Students, your dorm room allocations and class schedules are now live on the notice boards. Dismissed."</blockquote>

  <p class="narration">With that, the ceremony ended in a whirlwind of footsteps, conversations, and Kael quietly whispering to Calvin:</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "I think I just declared war on a queen."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "On the bright side‚Ä¶ you finally impressed a girl."</p>
    <p><strong>Kael:</strong> "She wants to kill me."</p>
    <p><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Exactly."</p>
