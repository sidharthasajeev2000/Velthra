      <h2>VELTHRA<br>Chapter 11 – Juice, Drama, and a Death Wish</h2>

      <p>The canteen was alive with chaos — clattering trays, food flying in corners, students shouting across tables like it was a gladiator arena of lunchtime politics.</p>
      <p>In the middle of it all sat Squad C-7, now complete with their newest honorary chaos gremlin: Trollin.</p>
      <p>How Calvin convinced him to join lunch was a mystery, but here he was, already locked in a petty squabble with Calvin over who got to sit beside Velmira.</p>
      <p>“She clearly said I could sit here,” Calvin argued, elbowing his way in.</p>
      <p>“She didn’t say you, she said ‘someone,’ and that someone has two working brain cells,” Trollin growled.</p>
      <p>Velmira pinched the bridge of her nose. “You two realize I can sit alone, right?”</p>
      <p>Neither of them backed down.</p>
      <p>Eventually, everyone settled. They dug into their food, filling the table with everything from noodles to whatever questionable meat Rio found appetizing.</p>
      <p>Mid-bite, Calvin suddenly smacked the table. “I have a mission!”</p>
      <p>“Let me guess,” Rio sighed. “It’s dumb.”</p>
      <p>Calvin ignored him. “Kael! You gotta patch things up with Selene.”</p>
      <p>Kael, chewing quietly, blinked. “...What? Why? I didn’t do anything.”</p>
      <p>“Exactly! When dealing with girls,” Calvin said, raising a wise finger, “you apologize even when you don’t know what you did wrong. It’s like rule one.”</p>
      <p>A hand smacked the back of his head.</p>
      <p>“Don’t teach him that,” Velmira muttered, still holding her tray like a weapon.</p>
      <p>She turned to Kael, softening. “Look, maybe she felt… I don’t know, overshadowed. You did win first place. Got all the attention. That stuff stings sometimes.”</p>
      <p>Calvin and Trollin stared at her like she just spoke ancient magic.</p>
      <p>She caught their ears. “Try being decent humans. It won’t kill you.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, man,” Rio chimed in. “Also, if she joins the crew, our squad rating gets an instant power-up.”</p>
      <p>Kael groaned. “So… we’re bribing a murder queen to upgrade the team?”</p>
      <p>Trollin nodded solemnly. “I support this plan. Also, I may or may not have given her permission to mess with you.”</p>
      <p>Everyone turned.</p>
      <p>“Not that I meant it!” he quickly corrected. “It was hypothetical!”</p>
      <p>“Cool. So I’m gonna die,” Kael muttered.</p>
      <p>“No no,” Calvin grinned. “You're gonna apologize… like a man. Go on!”</p>
      <p>Kael stood up, still chewing, dread in his soul.</p>
      <p>Across the canteen, Selene sat alone — composed, elegant, and very much not radiating “please talk to me” energy.</p>
      <p>Kael took one step, then stopped. “Do I… take anything?”</p>
      <p>Calvin’s eyes lit up. “Of course you do! You never go without a peace offering!”</p>
      <p>Then, like a predator striking, he snatched Rio’s juice.</p>
      <p>“HEY! That was mine!” Rio cried.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s diplomacy!” Calvin declared, holding the drink high with dramatic flair.</p>
      <p>“Take this,” he added solemnly, like he was bestowing a legendary weapon. “It’s not just juice. It’s symbolic reparation.”</p>
      <p>Kael stared at the juice. Then at Calvin. Then at his friends.</p>
      <p>Velmira gave him a thumbs-up. “Girls like surprises. Go!”</p>
      <p>Rio gave him a thumbs-down. “She’s going to kill you.”</p>
      <p>Kael sighed, turned, and made his way toward her — juice trembling slightly in his hand.</p>
      <p>And then the gods betrayed him.</p>
      <p>Just as he reached Selene’s table, someone behind him stood up, bumping into his back.</p>
      <p>Splash.</p>
      <p>The juice — the cursed, betrayal-born juice — poured down over Selene’s head, soaking her perfectly kept hair, uniform, and pride.</p>
      <p>Kael stood frozen.</p>
      <p>Selene was still. Drenched. Her once-perfect hair clung to her face in fruit-scented vengeance, like a soggy halo of doom. A half-eaten plate now rested above her head, stuck like a crown forged in pure rage.</p>
      <p>Then her eyes opened.</p>
      <blockquote>“You.”</blockquote>
      <p>Kael squeaked. Yes, squeaked.</p>
      <blockquote>“First on the stage. Then the dorm. Then class,” she roared, rising like a goddess of wrath. “You NEVER give me peace!”</blockquote>
      <p>She swung her plate like a battle axe. Kael ducked just in time.</p>
      <p>He turned to his squad.</p>
      <p>All of them had their hands on their faces, watching through their fingers like they were witnessing a tragic live-action train crash.</p>
      <p>Kael silently mouthed: Help me.</p>
      <p>Calvin mouthed back: RUN.</p>
      <p>Kael didn’t wait for a second signal.</p>
      <p>He dived out the side window and vanished like a ninja escaping his own funeral.</p>
      <p>Later that day, the gang regrouped in the classroom.</p>
      <p>Kael returned like a soldier from war — hair wild, uniform ripped at the sleeve, and an expression that said he’d seen things no man should see.</p>
      <p>Calvin scooted over casually, hands up like he wasn’t the cause of the mayhem. “Hey man…”</p>
      <p>Kael grabbed him by the collar and slowly started squeezing his neck — not hard enough to choke, but hard enough to ruin Calvin’s next three minutes.</p>
      <blockquote>“You. And your stupid gift. And your diplomatic juice box.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“My bad! My bad! I was just trying to help—”</blockquote>
      <p>“Boys.” Velmira’s voice sliced through like a general on a battlefield.</p>
      <p>She stepped in, pried them apart like a mom separating toddlers.</p>
      <p>Kael collapsed into his seat, exhausted. “She lives next to me. What am I supposed to do now?”</p>
      <p>Calvin rubbed his neck. “Okay. Maybe… more gifts.”</p>
      <p>Kael glared.</p>
      <p>“Right. No gifts. No juice. Not even coupons. Let me think. We’ll fix it. Promise.”</p>
      <p>Kael looked across the room.</p>
      <p>Selene sat at her desk — still faintly stained with juice, arms crossed, scribbling something in her notebook with deadly calm.</p>
      <p>Was it notes?</p>
      <p>Was it a kill list?</p>
      <p>Kael didn’t want to know.</p>
      <p>He slumped forward with a groan. “I’m so dead.”</p>
