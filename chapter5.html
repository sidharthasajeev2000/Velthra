      <h2>Chapter 5 – The Hunter’s Bluff</h2>

      <p>The next day, Trollin's team fanned out cautiously across the terrain. Their formation was tight, every movement calculated. They expected another sniper assault—Rio had made his presence impossible to ignore.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, a shot rang out.</p>

      <p>Clean. Sharp.</p>

      <p>But they were ready. The shield mage deflected it with practiced ease.</p>

      <blockquote>"Hold your positions!" Trollin barked. "He's using camouflage again. Stick to formation—he can’t isolate us this time."</blockquote>

      <p>He sneered, convinced of his control.</p>

      <blockquote>"Kael’s injured. He’s done. Calvin? A joke. Just another noise maker. We find the sniper, we win."</blockquote>

      <p>Another shot echoed—this time from a different angle.</p>

      <p>They shifted formation quickly, recalculating. Rio was trying to outflank them again. But this time, they believed they had him cornered.</p>

      <p>Then a third shot—closer.</p>

      <blockquote>"He’s baiting us," one of the squad muttered.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"No," Trollin snapped. "He’s slipping. Move in!"</blockquote>

      <p>They sprinted through brush and branches, closing in on the point of origin. Reaching the clearing, they found—</p>

      <p>Nothing.</p>

      <blockquote>"There’s no way he ran that fast," Trollin growled, scanning the surroundings. "His speed stats don’t match this."</blockquote>

      <p>Then—<em>crack crack crack</em>—shots rained down from above.</p>

      <p>From the trees.</p>

      <p>The shield mage scrambled to cover both Trollin and the enforcer as red-hot beams sliced through the air.</p>

      <blockquote>"Bring that tree down!" Trollin shouted. "He’s dead—this time for real. And I’m going to enjoy watching Calvin fall."</blockquote>

      <p>The enforcer roared and fired, blowing out the base of the tree. Wood splintered. Leaves exploded. A figure dropped through the canopy in a tangled fall.</p>

      <p>Trollin approached slowly, savoring every step.</p>

      <blockquote>"Let’s see your face, coward."</blockquote>

      <p>They yanked off the helmet—then froze.</p>

      <blockquote>"Rio?! What the hell—why are <em>you</em> here? And where’s your camo gear?"</blockquote>

      <p>Rio didn’t answer.</p>

      <p><em>Ping!</em></p>

      <p>A warning flashed across their HUDs. <strong>Shield Unit – Eliminated</strong></p>

      <p>Trollin turned, stunned. Too late.</p>

      <blockquote>"WHAT?!"</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"You were hunting the wrong ghost," Rio muttered.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"Kill him. NOW!" Trollin screamed.</blockquote>

      <p>The enforcer raised his axe.</p>

      <p><strong>CRACK!</strong></p>

      <p>A headshot dropped him instantly.</p>

      <blockquote>"It’s easier to shoot when the target’s big and not moving," Calvin chimed through comms, calm and sarcastic as ever.</blockquote>

      <p>Trollin spun—</p>

      <p>And a sword flew from the shadows.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t just a strike. It was judgment.</p>

      <p>The blade cut past his guard, slicing into his collar, sending him sprawling backward into the dirt.</p>

      <p>Kael stepped from behind a veil of camo, suit flickering as the stealth disengaged.</p>

      <p>He looked down at Trollin, unflinching.</p>

      <blockquote>"Still think Calvin’s just a clown?"</blockquote>

      <p>Trollin, gasping, watched as his HUD faded to red—<strong>disqualified</strong>. His last image before shutdown: Kael rising above him, the one he dismissed as broken.</p>

      <p>The forest flickered away.</p>

      <p>Leaves dissolved into pixels. Trees faded to wireframe. The arena returned to steel and stone beneath their feet—clean, clinical, cold.</p>

      <p>They had won.</p>

      <p>But the silence said otherwise.</p>

      <p>Trollin shot forward, teeth bared in rage, swinging a fist at Kael. Kael dodged cleanly, not even flinching.</p>

      <blockquote>“HE MUST HAVE CHEATED!” Trollin roared, stumbling.</blockquote>

      <p>The crowd gasped—then murmurs turned into voices.</p>

      <blockquote>“No way he lost…”<br>“That guy’s a noble…”<br>“They had to cheat…”</blockquote>

      <p>Trollin pointed at Kael, spitting his words like venom.</p>

      <blockquote>“There’s no way a bunch of loser commoners beat a Drake. The test was rigged. He <em>cheated!</em>”</blockquote>

      <p>The arena murmured louder—<strong>against</strong> Squad C-7.</p>

      <p>Calvin stepped forward, fists clenched.</p>

      <blockquote>“Are you people blind?! He tried to cheat <em>reality</em> and still got dropped!”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Silence,” a new voice cut through.</blockquote>

      <p>A man in Federation proctor robes stepped forward, slow, confident.</p>

      <p>And smiling.</p>

      <blockquote>“After careful consideration… Squad C-7 is hereby disqualified for suspected cheating.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael stared.</p>

      <blockquote>“What?! How did we cheat?”</blockquote>

      <p>The proctor didn’t even flinch.</p>

      <blockquote>“You cheated… because I said so.”</blockquote>

      <p>Gasps from the crowd. Trollin smirked. Calvin looked like he was about to explode.</p>

      <p>Kael leaned toward him.</p>

      <blockquote>“You okay?”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“That bastard's from the Basthurds family,A branch of Drake” Calvin growled. “They cover for their own.”</blockquote>

      <p>Kael clenched his jaw. The victory meant nothing now. The Nobles were showing its colors.</p>

      <blockquote>“CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION!” someone shouted from the crowd.</blockquote>

      <p>A blur landed between them and the proctor—<strong>a girl</strong>, mid-air flip, boots hitting the stone with a metallic <em>clang</em>.</p>

      <p>She marched straight toward the proctor.</p>

      <p>Calvin’s eyes widened.</p>

      <blockquote>“W-Why are you here?” he asked, suddenly awkward.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I <em>study here</em>, idiot!” she snapped.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“But I thought you transferred—wait—you…”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Shut up. I’m handling this.”</blockquote>

      <p>Calvin stood still. Like a dog hearing his owner’s voice.</p>

      <p>Kael blinked.</p>

      <blockquote>“…is he actually afraid of someone?”</blockquote>

      <p>Rio narrowed his eyes.</p>

      <blockquote>“Are we still in the simulation? Calvin looks like he just got hit with a system freeze.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Let’s find out,” Kael whispered.</blockquote>

      <p>The two slipped through the chaos toward him.</p>

      <blockquote>“Who <em>is</em> she?” Kael asked.</blockquote>

      <p>Calvin, sweating bullets, stammered:</p>

      <blockquote>“Remember when I said I… uh… dated Trollin’s—”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“SISTER?!” Trollin screamed from across the arena.</blockquote>

      <p>Everyone turned.</p>

      <p>Kael and Rio looked at Calvin.</p>

      <p>Calvin gave them a sheepish grin and a guilty thumbs-up.</p>

      <blockquote>“Yup. That one.”</blockquote>
